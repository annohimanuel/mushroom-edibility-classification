# Project Requirements: Mushroom Edibility Classification

## Objective
Train a binary classifier that predicts whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous using categorical attributes.

## Deliverables
1. Data preprocessing and validation (missing values, class balance)
2. One-hot encoding of features + label encoding of target
3. Baseline neural network + confusion matrix evaluation
4. PCA reduction retaining 95% variance
5. Second neural network trained on PCA features
6. Saved artifacts for reuse (PCA transformer and/or trained model)

## Success Criteria
- High test accuracy with minimal safety-critical errors
- Confusion matrix shows no or extremely low false negatives
- Reproducible pipeline end-to-end
